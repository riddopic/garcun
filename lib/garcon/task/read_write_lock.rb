module Garcon

  # read-write Lock for cooking safety.
  #
  # Allows any number of concurrent readers, but only one concurrent writer
  # (And if the "write" lock is taken, any readers who come along will have to
  # wait). If readers are already active when a writer comes along, the writer
  # will wait for all the readers to finish before going ahead. Any additional
  # readers that come when the writer is already waiting, will also wait (so
  # writers are not starved).
  #
  # @example
  #   lock = Garcon::ReadWriteLock.new
  #   lock.with_read_lock  { data.retrieve }
  #   lock.with_write_lock { data.modify! }
  #
  # @note
  #   Do **not** try to acquire the write lock while already holding a read lock
  #   **or** try to acquire the write lock while you already have it.
  #   This will lead to deadlock
  #

    # Implementation notes:
    # * A goal is to make the uncontended path for both readers/writers
    #   lock-free.
    # * Only if there is reader-writer or writer-writer contention, should
    #   locks be used.
    # * Internal state is represented by a single integer ("counter"), and
    #   updated using atomic compare-and-swap operations.
    # * When the counter is 0, the lock is free.
    # * Each reader increments the counter by 1 when acquiring a read lock (and
    #   decrements by 1 when releasing the read lock).
    # * The counter is increased by (1 << 15) for each writer waiting to
    #   acquire the write lock, and by (1 << 30) if the write lock is taken.
